Jungle
======
Embedded key-value storage library, based on a combined index of [LSM-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree) and [copy-on-write (append-only) B+tree](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/lsf07/tech/rodeh.pdf). Please refer to our [paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotstorage19/presentation/ahn).

Jungle is specialized for building [replicated state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication) of consensus protocols such as [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)) or [Raft](https://raft.github.io/), by providing chronological ordering and lightweight persistent snapshot. It can be also used for building log store.


Features
--------
* Ordered mapping of key and its value on disk (file system). Both key and value are arbitrary length binary.
* Monotonically increasing sequence number for each key-value modification.
* Point lookup on both key and sequence number.
* Range lookup on both key and sequence number, by using iterator:
    * Snapshot isolation: each individual iterator is a snapshot.
    * Bi-directional traversal and jump: `prev`, `next`, `gotoBegin`, `gotoEnd`, and `seek`.
* Lightweight persistent snapshot, based on sequence number:
    * Nearly no overhead for the creation of a snapshot.
    * Snapshots are durable; preserved even after process restart.
* Tunable configurations:
    * The number of threads for log flushing and compaction.
    * Custom size ratio between LSM levels.
    * Compaction factor (please refer to the paper).
* Log store mode:
    * Ordered mapping of sequence number and value, eliminating key indexing.
    * Lightweight log truncation based on sequence number.

### Things we DO NOT (and also WILL NOT) support
* Secondary indexing, or SQL-like query:
    * Jungle will not understand the contents of value. Value is just a binary from Jungle's point of view.
* Server-client style service, or all other network-involving tasks such as replication:
    * Jungle is a library that should be embedded into your process.


Benefits
--------
Compared to other widely used LSM-based key-value storage libraries, benefits of Jungle are as follows:

* Smaller write amplification.
    * Jungle will have 4-5 times less write amplification, while providing the similar level of write performance.
* Chronological ordering of key-value pairs
    * Along with persistent logical snapshot, this feature is very useful when you use it as a replicated state machine for Paxos or Raft.



How to Build
------------
#### 1. Install `cmake`: ####
* Ubuntu
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
```

* OSX
```sh
$ brew install cmake
```

#### 2. Build ####
```sh
jungle$ ./prepare.sh -j8
jungle$ mkdir build
jungle$ cd build
jungle/build$ cmake ../
jungle/build$ make
```

Run unit tests:
```

Coding Convention
-----------------
* Recommended not to exceed 90 characters per line.
* Indent: 4 spaces, K&R (1TBS).
* Class & struct name: `UpperCamelCase`.
* Member function and member variable name: `lowerCamelCase`.
* Local variable, helper function, and parameter name: `snake_case`.

```C++
class MyClass {
public:
    void myFunction(int my_parameter) {
        int local_var = my_parameter + 1;
        if (local_var < myVariable) {
            // ...
        } else {
            // ...
        }
    }
private:
    int myVariable;
};

int helper_function() {
    return 0;
}
```

* Header include order: local to global.
    1. Header file corresponding to this source file (if applicable).
    2. Header files in the same project (i.e., Jungle).
    3. Header files from the other projects.
    4. C++ system header files.
    5. C system header files.
    * Note: alphabetical order within the same category.
    * Example (`my_file.cc`):
```C++
#include "my_file.h"            // Corresponding header file.

#include "table_file.h"         // Header files in the same project.
#include "table_helper.h"

#include "forestdb.h"           // Header files from the other projects.

#include <cassert>              // C++ header files.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#include <sys/stat.h>           // C header files.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
